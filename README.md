# ETL-Project

### Datasets Used:
1. https://www.baseball-reference.com/
2. https://openweathermap.org/api

### What useful investigation could be done with my final database?
My database will combine game schedule data for the Houston Astros in selected years with weather data for each of those game days. This database can be used to investigate how weather affects: player performance, team wins versus losses, game attendance by fans, etc. 

This database will be relational.
